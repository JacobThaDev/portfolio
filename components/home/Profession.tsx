                I&apos;m <strong>Jacob Smith</strong>, a well respected and independent website developer and avid gamer from Texarkana, Texas. 
                Every website is hand crafted to be sleek and professional using NextJS, NodeJS, and TailwindCSS. I focus on clean and maintainable
                code and like to experiment in my free time. I also like to squash edge-cases for fun.
